Elf Elfonsinio is a Christmas-themed arcade game. Elf was summoned to Claus Clausie's office because he had done something badâ€”carved toothpicks from Clausie's sleigh. As punishment, he must help Clausie decorate the Christmas tree.

The player's task is to hang Christmas tree decorations in their assigned places. You can choose from seven types of ornaments. Every correct placement earns points, but if you hang an ornament in the wrong spot, your score will be reduced by the total points earned thus far. If you lose all your lives, the game is over. This short game features enjoyable sound and music, as well as a delightful Christmas theme.
