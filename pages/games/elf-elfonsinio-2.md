Elf Elfonsinio 2 continues the adventures of the goofy elf who serves as Santa's helper, living in peace and tranquility at the North Pole. This time, our main character receives a special and highly responsible task from Santa.

EE2 is a classic platform game where players must gather collectibles and avoid enemies. The game takes players through three worlds, each representing a different season: summer, fall, and winter. In each world, players will encounter various types of enemies and unique background elements.
