Your task in this game is to score as many points as possible by smashing falling boulders. To assist you, there are additional bonuses available, such as Mega Jump or a double-barreled gun. You can also earn more points by surviving longer without losing a life. For every second you stay alive, you will receive an additional number of points equal to the current level number.
