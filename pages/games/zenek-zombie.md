Zenek Zombie is a platform game that combines elements of adventure and skill progression. Players take on the role of Zenek, who witnesses the kidnapping of his wife. Despite not being particularly brave, the protagonist decides to search for her.

Zenek receives assistance from his grandfather, who teaches him magic. He journeys through a world filled with enemies, collecting money and diamonds along the way. Players can use the money to purchase healing potions, acquire additional lives, or increase Zenek's magic level. Diamonds can also be earned by completing quests throughout the game.
