A game that requires cleverness and a bit of thinking. The player's task is to free Chleba by switching on a hoist that elevates the cage. You take the role of Kromka, who instead of legs has a huge pen spring. On your way, you will have to beat various enemiesâ€”from little tanks to cannons firing huge bullets.
